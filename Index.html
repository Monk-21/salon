          “I recently visited Lush & Glow for a haircut and hair spa, and I must say I was blown away! The stylist was super friendly and understood exactly what I wanted. The products used felt premium, and my hair has never felt this soft and healthy. Definitely the best place for hair care in Raipur.”<br><small>— Priya Sharma</small>

        <div class="testimonial">
          “One thing that truly stood out to me at Lush & Glow was how clean and well-maintained the salon was. From sanitized tools to neatly arranged stations, everything reflected professionalism. The ambience is so relaxing—calming music, soothing lighting, and a peaceful vibe. It felt more like a retreat than just a salon visit.”<br>     <small>— Aisha Khan</small>

          “I chose Lush & Glow for my engagement makeup, and they made me look like an absolute princess! The makeup artist took the time to understand my skin and preferences. The final look was elegant, not overdone. I received so many compliments. I’m booking them again for my wedding without a second thought!”<br><small>— Neha Patel</small>

          From the moment I walked in, I was treated with warmth and respect. The reception staff was attentive and offered me water and magazines while I waited. Every team member was polite and genuinely interested in making me feel comfortable. That level of hospitality makes Lush & Glow stand out.<br><small>— Sandhya Soni</small>

          I tried their organic facial treatment, and it was heavenly. The products smelled amazing and felt gentle on my skin. The esthetician explained every step, which I appreciated. My skin looked radiant and felt deeply hydrated afterwards. It’s been a week, and I’m still glowing! Totally worth the investment.<br><small>— Aditi Verma</small>

          What surprised me most was how affordable their services are considering the high-end experience they offer. I got a full makeover done for an event, and the prices were reasonable without any compromise on quality. Lush & Glow proves you don’t need to go to a metro city for premium salon services!<br><small>— Kanak Sahu</small>
